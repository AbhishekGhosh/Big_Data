# Big Data - Project Brief

### Background and Aim
The aim is to build an infrastructure for big data, analyse it and draw meaningful conclusions. The project will be divided into two ones, differentiated on the fact that they will utilize different big data platforms(Cloudera and IBM open platform respectively). The datasets used in the two projects will be different, and preferably chosen from an ongoing open challenge in the field.

### Solution
Both projects aim to transfer a dataset to its chosen big data platform for the purpose of  analysing it. One issue that will be central to the project is the choice of analytical methods and their implementation. Success will depend on to which extent the group has familiarised themselves with the available software and tools of the respective platforms. Steps will be taken to ensure members have practiced the useage of them in solving likely tasks.

### Organization
The group is divided into two separate smaller groups where each smaller group have one project as their responsibility. The aim is still for everyone to be involved in both projects however, and as such the role of leader for the entire project will be alternated throughout the weeks.
The two projects will make use of different big data platforms, and the group members will acquaint themselves appropriately with these through reading and practice.
There is a variable hardware requirement in regards to the project. Preferably each of the two projects will have access to a cluster of computers to distribute its storage and computing on, but this is no strict requirement. Inescapably however, the two groups do require access to a computer with large amounts of primary memory in order to utilize the big data platforms.
The timeframe for the project is eight weeks, with the tasks to be accomplished visualised in a Gantt chart.
